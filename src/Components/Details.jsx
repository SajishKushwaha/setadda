            Booking your bus tickets well in advance is a tried-and-true method for getting the lowest prices. Most online booking platforms offer attractive discounts for those who plan ahead. Therefore, as soon as your travel dates are confirmed, don't hesitate to make reservations. By doing so, you lock in a lower fare and ensure your seat on the bus.
